description: Install Linux inside windows with WSL

Some people may want to use some linux tools or just prefer linux for development, but don't want to switch away from
Windows. WSL provides a virtual linux environment for the user to make full use of linux applications and as of recent
even GUI application with Windows 11.

# Prerequisits
- Windows 10 version 2004 (build 19041 and higher) or Windows 11

# Step 1
Firstly open a command prompt or powershell Windows, by opening the start menu and searching for "PowerShell", or "CMD"
if you prefer, but I prefer PowerShell.

# Step 2
Once the powershell, or cmd, window has opened, WSL can be installed with 
```batch
wsl --install
```

This command will install Ubuntu by default, but this behaviour can be customized to install other linux distors. You can
see what distros are available with the
```batch
wsl --list --online
```
command, and then install you chosen distro with
```batch
wsl --install -d <distro-name>
```

# Step 3
Once the distro has installed, you can launch a session by finding the distro in the start menu, for example ubuntu,
you will then be prompted to enter a username and password, this doesn't have to be the same as you windows credentials,
but you might elect to keep them the same for simplicityâ€™s sake.

# Conclusion
You now have a working WSL distribution installed and setup on your computer
